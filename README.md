## Introduction

SkyGround Chronicles is a Wabbajack modlist built around Requiem, Legacy of the Dragonborn, and BFCO with its full Stance system, all while pushing visuals to the limit. It supports both ENB and Community Shaders, delivering a visually stunning and deeply immersive RPG experience.

If you're curious about the specific mods in the list, the full modlist can be viewed [here](loadorderlibrary.com/lists/skyground-chronicles).

### System Requirements

**DISCLAIMERS:**
- SkyGround Chronicles only supports English Steam versions of Skyrim SE. GOG and other languages are not supported.
- HDD and external SSD installs are absolutely not supported.
- Any remote PC / desktop services or apps are not supported. (Including Steam Link)
- Only Windows 10/11 operating systems are supported. Windows LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK.**
- At least 8GB of GPU VRAM minimum is recommended for the list (1080p), otherwise you'll experience frequent stutters in exteriors. Higher resolutions may require even more.
